The testnet is the testing environment for the Daodiseo network. Use this guide to simulate transactions on the testnet.

If this is your first time using Daodiseo Station, follow the [Daodiseo Station tutorial](download/daodiseo-station-desktop.md).

## Get testnet Odis
1. Open Daodiseo Station and connect your wallet.
2. In the bottom left corner of Daodiseo Station, switch **Mainnet** to **Testnet**.
2. Copy your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Daodiseo station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `daodiseo<random-numbers-and-letters>`
3. Open your browser and navigate to the [Daodiseo Faucet <img src="/img/Faucet.svg" height="20px">](https://faucet.daodiseo.money).
4. Paste your Daodiseo address in the **Testnet address** field, select Odis, and click **Send me tokens**.

You now have funds in your Testnet wallet. Use the testnet just like you would use the mainnet. Make sure to switch back to the mainnet to make real transactions.
