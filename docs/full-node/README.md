# Full node

If you're a real estate developer looking to launch a new development project, you're in luck! ODISEO Network welcomes new projects and offers assistance to become validators on our platform.

As a real estate developer, you understand the importance of innovation and staying ahead of the curve. By becoming a validator on ODISEO Network, you can leverage the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize the way real estate projects are developed and financed.

Our platform allows for the creation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to house your development project. These SPVs are then tokenized, meaning that investors can purchase fractional ownership of the project using cryptocurrency. This opens up a whole new world of investment opportunities, as investors from all over the world can now participate in your project without the traditional barriers to entry.

Not only does this provide a new funding source for your project, but it also offers increased transparency and accountability. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that every participant in the project has access to the same information.

ODISEO Network offers a range of services to help you become a validator, including technical support and access to our network of investors. Our team of experts is dedicated to ensuring that your project is a success, from conception to completion.

Join us today and take advantage of the opportunities offered by blockchain technology. With ODISEO Network, your real estate development project can become a leader in innovation and profitability.
